# Signal Generator
 
This function generator was designed for use in testing electronic circuits and components.
The most used signals in this field are sinusoidal, rectangular, triangular and sawtooth. These are also the signals I set out to generate.
In order to be able to use the signals depending on the specifications of application that requires testing, I introduced the modification of the frequency, amplitude and offset characteristics.
This project is powered by the development board STM32 Nucleo-F303RE, it uses an LCD module of 128x64 pixels, AD converters MCP4921, amplifiers OPA355UA, LED encoders
